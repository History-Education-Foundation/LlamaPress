Description:
    Used for our LLM Bot to generate new Rails code, with tags needed for the LLM to modify later.
    This generator helps non-technical users create custom features they want by automating
    the process of setting up the necessary components in the Rails application.

Example:
    bin/rails generate llama_scaffold CustomUserFeature

    This will create:
        - A database migration to add the necessary tables or columns
        - A model file to define the feature's data structure and relationships
        - Updates to the routes file to add appropriate URLs for the feature
        - A controller file to handle the feature's logic and actions
        - View files to display the feature's user interface

How it works:
    1. Run the command with your desired feature name (e.g., CustomUserFeature)
    2. The generator will automatically create and modify the required files
    3. Review the generated code and make any necessary adjustments
    4. Use the new feature in your Rails application

Note: This generator simplifies the process of adding new features, but some
technical knowledge may still be required for fine-tuning and integration.
